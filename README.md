 **This is the main UI for [Omega Governance](http://omegacoin.network/). The application will cover all following OMEGA aspects:**
 1) OMEGA Governance UI for DAPPS deployment
 2) Oracle, Docker and other virtualizations
 3) Graphene extended assets management DEX
 4) OMEGA blockchain with 2000+ Masternodes view and personal masternodes management
 5) Controlled Staking
 
 **Project code formatting requirements:**
 1. Make sure all the files in the project have LF line endings. Use eclipse to correct all project files line endings if needed.
 2. Use maven formatter to format code before each commit. Formatter won't correct all line ending to LF only those files that were edited. https://trello.com/c/YwN6iE8N/25-project-maven-unified-formatter-is-not-formatting-project-lineending-as-expected
